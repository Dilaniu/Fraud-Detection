# Fraud-Detection
Insurance claims fraud detection using Decision tress and random forest along with with hyperparameter tuning 

Abstract:
A large number of problems in data mining are related to fraud detection. Fraud is a common problem in
auto insurance claims, health insurance claims, credit card transactions, financial transaction and so on.
The data in this particular case comes from an actual auto insurance company. Each record represents an
insurance claim. The last column in the table tells you whether the claim was fraudulent or not. A number
of people have used this dataset and here are some observations from them:

• “This is interesting data because the rules that most tools are coming up with do not make any
intuitive sense. I think a lot of the tools are overfitting the data set.”
• “The other systems are producing low error rates but the rules generated make no sense.”
• “It is OK to have a higher overall error rate with simple human-understandable rules for a
business use case like this.”
